I support PdPR during the summit. It's just for a short time and helps reduce congestion.
PdPR again? Students already suffered enough during the pandemic. Not fair!
Good move. Less traffic in KL means less stress for everyone.
How are working parents supposed to handle PdPR on such short notice?
This is a responsible decision. Hosting ASEAN leaders requires smooth traffic flow.
Online classes don’t work for every student. The ministry should reconsider.
Why not just declare school holidays for those days instead of going through PdPR?
It’s about time the government prioritizes education planning instead of traffic.
I think it’s a balanced approach. Let the summit go on while students stay safe at home.
My kids didn’t learn much during PdPR last time. This will hurt their education again.
It’s a temporary compromise. I’m okay with it as long as the teachers are informed early.
Typical knee-jerk reaction. What’s the educational benefit here?
We always complain but offer no solutions. At least this helps with logistics during the summit.
Why should students suffer just because the government can’t manage traffic?
I'm worried about internet access for rural students. PdPR isn't equal for everyone.
They better provide proper support materials for home learning this time.
Smart move. Less cars on the road will improve Malaysia’s image to international guests.
This shows poor planning. We knew about the summit months ago.
Can the ministry promise this won’t affect exam preparation?
Honestly, a few days of PdPR isn’t the end of the world. We should be flexible.
